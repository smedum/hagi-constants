# HAGI Constants Reference Implementation

Six mathematical constants for harmonious artificial general intelligence:

1. **δ** (Delta) - Dynamic Coherence: Measures logical consistency
2. **γ** (Gamma) - Perceptual Fidelity: Measures reconstruction quality  
3. **ι** (Iota) - Inferential Depth: Measures reasoning chain reliability
4. **ρ** (Rho) - Resource Efficiency: Measures computational efficiency
5. **α** (Alpha) - Adaptive Generality: Measures knowledge retention
6. **σ** (Sigma) - Conceptual Stability: Measures robustness to perturbation

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smedum/hagi-constants
cd hagi-constants
make check
