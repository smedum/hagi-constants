## Why This Exists

**Stop guessing, start measuring.** Most AGI projects fail because they optimize for the wrong things. This gives you six proven metrics to build systems that actually work.

## What You Get

Six mathematical constants that tell you if your AI system is fundamentally sound:

- **δ Coherence** - Is it logically consistent or contradicting itself?
- **γ Fidelity** - Is it distorting reality or preserving truth?
- **ι Depth** - Can it reason deeply without breaking?
- **ρ Efficiency** - Is it wasting resources or computing smartly?
- **α Adaptability** - Can it learn new things without forgetting old ones?
- **σ Stability** - Does it break under pressure or stay reliable?

## For Researchers & Engineers

**If you're building AGI systems**, use these constants to:
- Catch design flaws before they become catastrophic
- Compare architectures with objective metrics
- Prove your system's reliability to stakeholders
- Build on proven mathematical foundations instead of guesswork

**If you're evaluating AI research**, use these to:
- Separate real progress from hype
- Reproduce and verify claims in minutes, not months
- Understand exactly where systems succeed and fail
