# Contributing to HAGI Constants

Contributions that improve algorithmic efficiency, test coverage, or documentation are welcome! Please open an issue first to discuss major changes.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes  
4. Run `make check` to verify everything works
5. Submit a pull request

## What We're Looking For

- **Algorithm improvements**: More accurate implementations of the six constants
- **Performance optimizations**: Faster computation while maintaining accuracy
- **Test coverage**: Additional test cases and edge coverage
- **Documentation**: Clearer explanations, better examples
- **Bug fixes**: Any issues with current implementations

## Before Major Changes

For significant modifications to the constants or architecture, please:
1. Open an issue describing the proposed change
2. Discuss with maintainers
3. Implement once consensus is reached

Thank you for helping advance reproducible AGI research!
